# ETL-Pipeline-for-Weather-Data-using-Apache-Airflow-on-AWS
This project automates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to fetch current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, transform it, and load it into an S3 bucket. 
The workflow is orchestrated and scheduled using Apache Airflow, an open-source platform for managing data pipelines. 
The entire process runs on the AWS cloud platform, utilizing Airflow sensors to ensure efficient and reliable data handling.
